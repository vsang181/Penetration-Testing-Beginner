# Website Reconnaissance & Footprinting

In this documentation, we will explore the process of performing passive reconnaissance, specifically focusing on websites. Additionally, we'll delve into the concept of footprinting, a crucial step in penetration testing. This guide will cover what footprinting is, its importance, and the various techniques and tools used.

### What is Website Reconnaissance?

Website reconnaissance is the initial phase of a penetration test focusing on gathering information about a target website without directly interacting with it. This phase is critical as it helps build an understanding of the target's infrastructure, which is essential for the success of later stages of testing.

### What is Footprinting?

Footprinting is a subset of reconnaissance. While reconnaissance broadly refers to gathering any kind of information, footprinting is more targeted, focusing on gathering specific details that are directly relevant to the target. This includes identifying IP addresses, domain information, and any other data that could expose potential vulnerabilities.

### The Importance of Website Reconnaissance & Footprinting

Effective website reconnaissance and footprinting provide valuable insights into the target’s infrastructure. This information is used to identify potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities that could be exploited in later stages. The data gathered during this phase informs the strategies and tools used in subsequent stages, such as vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation.

## Key Information to Gather

When conducting website reconnaissance and footprinting, several critical pieces of information should be collected:

- **IP Addresses**: Identifying the IP address of the web server hosting the website.

- **Directories Hidden from Search Engines**: Locating directories that might be hidden from search engines or not immediately visible on the website.

- **Names**: Gathering names of key individuals associated with the target organization, which could be useful for social engineering attacks.

- **Email Addresses**: Collecting email addresses of employees or departments within the organization, which could be leveraged in phishing attacks.

- **Phone Numbers**: Identifying phone numbers listed on the website or associated with the domain, useful for social engineering.

- **Physical Addresses**: Gathering physical addresses of the organization, which could be relevant for physical security assessments or further reconnaissance.

- **Web Technologies Being Used**: Identifying the web technologies in use, such as the content management system (CMS), server software, and other third-party integrations.

- **robots.txt**: Analyzing the `robots.txt` file for directories or URLs that might be restricted from search engines but are still accessible.

- **sitemap.xml**: Examining the `sitemap.xml` file to discover the structure of the website and uncover hidden pages or directories.

- **Website Copying for Offline Analysis**: Using tools like HTTrack to create a full copy of the website for offline analysis.

## Techniques for Passive Website Reconnaissance

#### 1. IP Address Discovery

IP address discovery involves finding the IP address of the target website’s server. This is a fundamental step in reconnaissance because IP addresses are essential for identifying and interacting with network devices.

##### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Open a Terminal: Use a Linux-based terminal for the following commands.
2. Use the `host` Command: The `host` command is a DNS lookup utility that resolves a domain name to its IP address.
   - Example Command: `host <domain_name>`
   - Explanation: When you enter a domain name, the DNS lookup translates it into an IP address, which your browser uses to communicate with the web server.
3. Handling Proxies and Firewalls: Be aware that some websites may be behind proxies or firewalls like CloudFlare. These services may obscure the real IP address of the server.
   > Note: If the real IP address is behind a service like CloudFlare, additional techniques may be needed to bypass the proxy.

#### 2. DNS Lookup

DNS lookups provide valuable information about the domain name system records associated with the target website. This can include information about subdomains, mail servers, and other domain-related records.

##### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Use the `dig` Command: `dig` (Domain Information Groper) is a powerful tool for querying DNS name servers.
   - Example Command: `dig <domain_name>`
   - Explanation: This command will return various DNS records, including A (address) records, MX (mail exchange) records, and CNAME (canonical name) records.
1. Analyze the Output: Look for critical information such as:
   - A Records: IP addresses of the domain.
   - MX Records: Email servers associated with the domain.
   - CNAME Records: Aliases for the domain.

#### 3. Directory Enumeration

Directory enumeration involves searching for hidden directories on the website that are not directly linked or visible. This is often done using tools that systematically test for common directory names.

##### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Use Tools like `dirb` or `gobuster`: These tools are designed to brute-force directories and file names on web servers.
   - Example Command: `gobuster dir -u http://<domain_name> -w /path/to/wordlist`
   - Explanation: This command tests the website for directories listed in a wordlist, providing a list of accessible directories.
2. Review the Results: Analyze the discovered directories for sensitive information, administrative portals, or configuration files that could be exploited.

#### 4. `robots.txt` Analysis

The `robots.txt` file provides instructions to search engine crawlers about which parts of the website should not be indexed. However, these directories and files are still accessible if their URLs are known, making them a valuable target for reconnaissance.

##### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Access the `robots.txt` File: Visit `http://<domain_name>/robots.txt` in your browser.
   - Explanation: This file will list directories and files that are disallowed from being indexed by search engines.
2. Analyze Disallowed Entries: Look for any directories or files that might contain sensitive information.
   - Example: Disallowed entries might include `/admin/`, `/backup/`, or other directories that could contain important data.
3. Check for Misconfigurations: Ensure that the `robots.txt` file does not expose sensitive directories or files inadvertently.

#### 5. `sitemap.xml` Analysis

The `sitemap.xml` file provides a structured list of URLs available on the website, which is used by search engines to index the site. It can reveal hidden or less obvious pages.

##### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Access the `sitemap.xml` File: Visit `http://<domain_name>/sitemap.xml` in your browser.
   - Explanation: This file lists all the important URLs on the website that the site owner wants to be indexed by search engines.
2. Review the URLs: Analyze the listed URLs for any hidden or interesting content.
   - Example: The sitemap might include URLs to login pages, archives, or other sensitive areas that are not linked directly from the homepage.
3. Utilize the Sitemap for Further Reconnaissance: Use the information from the sitemap to focus further reconnaissance efforts on lesser-known parts of the website.

#### 6. Using WhatWeb for Web Technology Identification
